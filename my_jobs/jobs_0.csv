* We break down complex problems and consistently seek to find the most straightforward solutions.
* We take quality seriously and factor it into everything we do.
* We are comfortable with change, either in priorities, goals and deadlines. We see this more as an opportunity than a hurdle. We are not satisfied with the status quo and push for change.
* We seek those looking to make a severe impact and are excited about working in a high\-growth startup.
* We ship fast, continuously, and iteratively, learning each step.
* We are data\-informed. And are ok with finding the data when it’s missing.

 “As an engineer, I follow a product through its lifecycle, from ideation to delivery and support, which gives a lot of exposure to the technology and customer needs. This allows me to learn to improve both myself and the product constantly.” \- Philip Beel, Engineering Manager.
   

  

**What You Will Do**
* Learn about how painful it is for companies to handle tax manually, and think about how our products are changing the status quo
* Own what you build, with the ability to decide how to make it and the responsibility of operating it in the production environment.
* Build meaningful products with REST APIs that our customers use and depend on for everyday business (finance, operation, tax and developer teams)
* Build new product features across the stack, from back\-end business logic implementation to front\-end customer\-facing interfaces.
* Write high quality robust, modular code for frontend and backend
* Ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs as well as internal applications capabilities
* Record and collate lots and lots of data sets from all these operations for long\-term storage and future insight
* Use every learning and observation to improve our products, constantly
* Understand customer needs and the pain they are experiencing related to tax automation
* Understand competitive products


**You would be a great fit if**
* You are fully proficient in English. Written and spoken, we are from around the world, but we work in English.
* You have a strong sense of ownership, care about what you build, and do the right thing that serves your customers.
* You’re a builder at heart; you like the opportunity of having tons of exposure, making things work for a company long term, and having an entrepreneurial attitude toward anything that comes your way.
* You are either eager to learn or comfortable scaling and operating large\-scale microservices in high\-growth environments.
* You are proficient in a couple of languages; most of our current codebase is in node.js with Typescript and Go on the backend. We use ReactJS on the front end, but we are not married to any tools; we see them as a means to an end.
* You like to keep your house tidy and clean, and you just can't leave code not covered with a test. Or a feature undelivered. Or dead code rotting in production.
* You ship fast, continuously, and iteratively, learning each step.
* You like to use data over opinions to make decisions. And are ok with finding the data yourself when it’s missing.
* You are comfortable with change, either in priorities, goals and deadlines. You see this more as an opportunity than a hurdle. You are also satisfied with challenging the status quo and pushing for change.
* You want to make a severe impact and are excited about working in a high\-growth startup.

 If you feel you don’t have the whole experience we’re looking for but feel you could be a bit fit and are willing to learn, do apply anyway! We are trying to build a diverse and inclusive team.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.
   

  

 To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands\-on approach of an operator.
   

  

 For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.
   

  

**A few examples of your responsibilities** 
* **Master your toolkit.** 
 By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.
* **Build stuff that matters.** 
 Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.
* **Simplify relentlessly.** 
 Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future\-proof solutions.


**What we look for** 
* **Reasoning ability.** 
 Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
* **Drive.** 
 You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
* **Team spirit.** 
 You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
* **Proficiency in English.** 
 You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


**What we offer** 
* **Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams.** 
 You’ll work in small, result\-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
* **An exceptional opportunity for growth.** 
 We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
* **Competitive pay and access to equity in the company.** 
 Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
* **All. These. Benefits.** 
 Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top\-of\-the\-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.

 Kraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.
   

  

 We’re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.
   

  

 It’s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future.
   

  

**Kraken Customer**
 What we do: build the most AI\-driven, innovative, forward\-thinking platform for energy management. From optimising resources to delivering cost\-effective, exceptional customer experiences through advanced Customer Information Systems (CIS), billing, meter data management, CRM, and AI\-driven communications, Kraken is powering the next wave of innovation in the energy industry.
   

  

 Why we do it: future energy will not look like energy as we know it today. We need to not just think about our future, but build for it. Now.
   

  

**What You'll Do**
* We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The UK utilities market is complicated, outdated and process\-heavy \- there's an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.
* We have challenging technical problems to solve; like processing tens of millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption. Or thinking about how we adapt Kraken to improve other utilities like water and broadband.
* There's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis\-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.
* You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our generation arm is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and is funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.


**What You'll Need**
* We're looking for someone with a general interest in technology and problem\-solving; someone diligent and thoughtful. It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order):
* Python
* Django (or equiv. web framework)
* Domain modelling
* HTTP and REST APIs
* Writing robust and fault\-tolerant software
* Celery and async processing
* Postgres


**Plus Experience In The Following Would Be a Bonus**
* AWS
* Terraform, Packer, Consul


**Why else you'll love it here**
* Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Kraken \- what's more important to us is finding the right Kraken\-fit!
* Kraken has an unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co\-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! Our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people
* Visit our perks hub \- Kraken Employee Benefits


**If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.**
*Are you ready for a career with us? We want to ensure you have all the tools and environment you need to unleash your potential. Need any specific accommodations? Whether you require specific accommodations or have a unique preference, let us know, and we'll do what we can to customise your interview process for comfort and maximum magic!*
*Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone.*","Technology, Information and Internet",https://uk.linkedin.com/company/krakentech,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D0BAQHD0uhLz28lwg/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1691424308528/krakentech_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7k7aeQxkT2kFR_kPJCx_TPhF5KtiOnyoukV6hkskb3c,,,,,

**Grow with the challenge** 
  

  

 At the time of inception, cloud\-based systems and API fluency were new. But that didn't scare us. We waved goodbye to legacy systems and embraced modern technology – where our true innovation began and didn't stop.
   

  

 No hierarchy, no egos. Just a spirit of collaboration that flows right throughout our organisation – it’s woven into our DNA. We genuinely want to know about each other’s learnings and expertise, especially where it can help us achieve bigger things.
   

  

 At ClearBank, we make things happen. We solve problems together because we know that many heads are always better than one. Valuing different perspectives is what sets our culture apart. And being able to disagree and commit is key to our progress. Above all we’re a team because when we win together, it feels so much better than doing it alone.
   

  

**What You Can Expect**
 ClearBank is a place where you can do things differently and challenge the status quo. We will give you a high level of autonomy and transparency, and we trust you to make the right decisions for the bank.

* Implementing an appropriate level of testing to support the quality of the code
* Supporting enterprise systems and actively participating in incident management
* Identifying opportunities for improvement in our services and ways of working
* Being curious and a desire to keep learning

* C\# (.Net)
* Automated testing
* Databases
* Messaging systems (we use Azure Service Bus)
* Microservices
* Cloud computing and related concepts, preferably with Microsoft Azure


 Regretfully we are not able to sponsor applicants for immigration purposes at the current time.
   

  

**Our Tech Stack**

* Azure / Azure Dev Ops
* C\# (.Net)
* Terraform (infrastructure as code)
* Azure Service Bus
* Kubernetes
* Testing (unit / component / integration / e2e)
* Cosmos DB
* Microservices
* Appinsights / Kibana
* Pager Duty


**What makes a great ClearBank team member? Does this sound like you?** 
  

  

* You focus on solutions and positive outcomes, thinking radically and responsibly to find the best result for our customers, your colleagues and the bank;
* You actively seek feedback from others to drive your growth and development, always assuming positive intent from others and develop strong, trusting relationships you’re your colleagues and customers: you really, genuinely care;
* You always strive for the highest quality, but you know that done is better than perfect; you welcome a challenge knowing that they learn as you go and iterate;
* ‘I’ before ’we’, isn’t in your vocabulary
